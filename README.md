### Project to analyze the spread and impact of COVID 19 in NYC

I am a resident of NYC and an Applied Data Science Masters student (UMich). This project is an indpedent research study where I want to explore the spread and impact of COVID-19 through my city. I will be leveraging data from the CDC and NYC.gov from 2020 to June 2022. There are no predefined hypothesis to test; I simply want to explore and see if I find anything interesting.
