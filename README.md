## Analysis of COVID19 Trends for NYC 
#### Project to analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 in NYC (Jan '20 to Sep '22)

This independent research study utilizes CDC.gov data to explore the spread and impact of COVID-19 through NYC. Some of the questions analyzed in this study are - spread and impact of the various COVID-19 variants, as well as the impact of lockdowns/reopenings and vaccinations on the spread of the virus. Further, the study also explores if there are any commonalities in the health conditions associated with COVID related deaths.

### <center> Observations</center>

The largest increase in new cases was seen in Dec 2021 through Jan 2022, which outpaces new case increases seen in any other period during the pandemic, including April 2020. 
   - While the data provided does not indicate the type of variant asscoiated with each case, it is interesting to note that during this time period both the Delta variant and the Omnicron variant had been observed in US per [here](https://covariants.org/per-country?region=United+States&country=New+York&variant=20I+%28Alpha%2C+V1%29&variant=21A+%28Delta%29&variant=21I+%28Delta%29&variant=21J+%28Delta%29&variant=21K+%28Omicron%29&variant=21L+%28Omicron%29&variant=22A+%28Omicron%29&variant=22B+%28Omicron%29&variant=22C+%28Omicron%29&variant=22D+%28Omicron%29). 
   - Omicron is especially regarded as easily tranferrable and more infectious than prior variants which may have contributed to the increase in cases per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-classifications.html). 
   - However, it is also important to note the increased availability of testing resoures compared to earlier in the pandemic which certainly contributed to an increase in recorded cases.


Its also interesting to see that the large spikes in new cases observed later in the pandemic, do not have corresponding large increases in new deaths. The largest spike in new deaths is infact seen at the start of the pandemic ~April 2022.
   - We know that at the start of the pandemic, not a lot was known about the virus or appropriate treatment methods. 
   - At this time there was also extensive strain on medicals resources in the city and shortages in medical equipment and supplies. 
   - No vaccines were available at this time. Whereas nearly 95% of the NYC population had received atleast one dose of a COVID19 vaccine by YE2021.
