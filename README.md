## COVID-19 Analysis
### Project to analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 in NYC

Indepedent research study to explore the spread and impact of COVID-19 through my city (NYC). I've leveraged data from the CDC and NYC.gov for this project and the relevant timeperiod is Jan 2020 to June 2022. There are no predefined hypothesis to test; I simply want to explore and see if I find anything interesting.
